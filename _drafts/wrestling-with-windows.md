title: "Wrestling with Windows"
---

For most people, the first operating system they ever used was Windows, and that's no surprise since Windows has *completely dominated the desktop market for over 20 years*.

When I first started to learn the basics of web development, the only things I needed were a computer with a working operating system, a text editor, and a browser. But one eternity later, I started learning some advanced tools that you will most definitely need as a developer. But to my surprise, I've found that some of them just don't work the same on Windows.
