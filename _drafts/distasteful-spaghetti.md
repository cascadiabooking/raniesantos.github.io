title: "Distasteful Spaghetti"

Spaghetti is delicious. I love it, and who doesn't? Spaghetti is a great thing... unless you're talking about spaghetti code.

## What Is Spaghetti Code?

It is when your source code becomes so difficult to read and disorganized xxxxxxxxxx

## Why it's bad

clearly this is bad but more detail on its negative effects

- looking at your code in the future
- asking someone for help
- collaborating with a team

## Clean Code Basics

One of the most important rules to follow to have a clean codebase is the proper usage of indentation and whitespace. Always make sure that every pair of HTML tags, parentheses, brackets, and braces that aren't on the same line align perfectly. It can be very frustrating to go over an HTML document or a collection of functions where you can't clearly see where something starts and ends.

Line breaks can also add more clarity to your code. In a webpage for example, there are usually related groups of HTML tags that form major components of the page. You can make these components easily distinguishable at a glance by adding line breaks before and after its opening and closing tags.

As for [non-breaking] spaces, I've found that they're especially useful for control structures such as if-statements. When you have multiple conditions they can be made easily readable by adding spaces between conditions and operators. The same idea applies when you are using several functions in one line. You can use spaces to separate the multiple parentheses that are beside each other so that they aren't confusing to look at.

It's not only important to code neatly, it's also important to code *consistently*. Decide on a coding style. Whether you indent with tabs or spaces and no matter where you place curly braces, it's not really a big deal if you're just working on code by yourself. Just stick with it and try to avoid sporadically changing your coding style between projects. And if you're working with a team, make sure that you all decide to use the same style, regardless of whether or not it's the style you personally always use.

___

- purpose of the code, separation of concerns (MVC, PHP templating)
- organize not only the code but also the project directory structure

## A Place for Everything and Everything in Its Place

Don't mix everything into one file. The more lines of code you add the harder it will be to find things. Its better to split your code into several files with clear and descriptive filenames. You might think that it's tedious to sift through dozens of files and folders, but lots of code editors nowadays have a *fuzzy-finder* feature that makes opening files extremely quick and easy.

- something about empathy
